Implementation of an AI game agent that plays the solved game Teeko using a minimax strategy which assumes both player makes optimal moves to infer the agent's best move. The game states and game values used in the minimax algorithm are obtained by propogating successor states recursively from previous states and subsequently evaluated heuristically to obtain an unweighted sum of the likelihood of forming a winning configuration.  

### Teeko Rules

Teeko is the same as Tik-Tac-Toe except it has a 5x5 gameboard a player wins by placing 4 peices consequtively vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, or by 4 peices in the corners of a 3x3 square configuration (in other words, 4 peices would need ot be placed at (i-1, j-1), (i+1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j+1) respectively, where (i,j) would be the supposed center of the 3x3 square formed by these four peices).

In other words it has 4 win conditions: 4 vertical peices, 4 horizontal peices, 4 diagonal peices (left or right), and 4 3x3 corner peices

### Documentation and usage
The documentation of the code can be found in the src/documentation file in HTML, it is generated by doxygen.
To begin playing a game simply run teeko.py

### Acknowledgements
The game engine, objects, and class was provided by the course, as well as the documentation for the functions. The remaining code and documentation was written by me.
